This allowed the firms to be more agile, keep costs down and operate mostly free of union interference

Apple, in particular, stands out as allegedly unfair to its employees, prompting some to use Android phones, reportedly to help assure privacy as they look to unionize

Now, almost every major technology company is facing at least the possibility of having to deal with unions

This reminds me a bit of the smartphone battle between Apple and everyone else where, early on, companies did not take Apple seriously, and the then market leaders, Research in Motion (BlackBerry), Palm, Nokia and Microsoft were caught napping.

Unlike Apple, though, Tesla has had huge execution issues and substandard quality control over an extended period. This has led its competitors to finally realize they need to focus on electric cars if they are to do them right, and we are seeing that focus emerge with announcements of the creation of focused electric car divisions. Expect these new divisions to create stronger alternatives to Telsa and avoid the fate of Apple’s large competitors.

On top of this, the move to electric vehicles will force changes in automotive support and maintenance, increased electrical capacity, and propel an even greater move to sustainable energy production.
