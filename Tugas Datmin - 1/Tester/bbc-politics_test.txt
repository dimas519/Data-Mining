The United States applied new sanctions Tuesday on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has allied with Russia in its war on Ukraine.

A number of other Russians, including a judge, were also targeted with sanctions for human rights abuses, according to the US Treasury Department.
And the Biden administration targeted 11 Russian military leaders -- some of whom have been involved in suppressing Russian protestors and dissent in occupied areas of Ukraine -- with new sanctions.

In announcing the measures applied to military leaders, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, "The Russian government has intensified a crackdown against its own citizens' freedom of expression, including for members of the press, as well as freedom of association and peaceful assembly. Today in Russia, those who provide factual reporting on the invasion or criticize Putin face criminal charges."
This action comes as the National Guard "has cracked down on Russian citizens who have taken to the streets to protest their government's brutal campaign in Ukraine," Blinken said, adding that the list of Russian military officials hit includes Viktor Zolotov, the head of the National Guard of Russia.
In Belarus, the country north of Ukraine that has played a key role aiding Russia's attack, sanctions were applied to the country's authoritarian leader as well as his wife, Halina. They would block their property and interests in the United States, and prohibit Americans from engaging in transactions with them.
